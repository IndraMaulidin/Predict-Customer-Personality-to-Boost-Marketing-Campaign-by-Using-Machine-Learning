# Predict-Customer-Personality-to-Boost-Marketing-Campaign-by-Using-Machine-Learning
- Mini Project : Predict Customer Personality to Boost Marketing Campaign by Using Machine Learning from Rakamin Academy.

## Overview
A company can develop rapidly when it knows its customer personality behavior, so it can provide better services and benefits to customers who have the potential to become loyal customers. By processing historical marketing campaign data to improve performance and target the right customers so they can transact on the company's platform, from this data insight our focus is to create a cluster prediction model to make it easier for companies to make decisions

## Conversion Rate Analysis Based on Income, Spending and Age
Conversion rate analysis is a search for insight into the percentage data of website visitors and what actions they take while visiting the site, and whether their actions result in a purchase transaction or not while visiting the website, this can be done by performing feature engineering on the data variables presented, so that it can generate a new column, namely Conversion rate.
After the conversion rate is formed, it can be analyzed with other variables such as age, income, total spending, etc. so as to find a pattern of consumer behavior.

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Before starting data processing, the first step that must be done is to prepare raw data into clean data and ready to be processed. We will do data preprocessing, namely handling various data problems such as empty data, inappropriate data, to identifying data that is not needed.

## Data Modeling
In order for the results of the model to be valid and robust, we must have clean data and ready to be processed using the algorithm that we will use. Therefore, the data that has been cleaned in the previous stage will be used for data modeling by performing task clustering. At this stage, we will apply the k-means clustering algorithm to the existing dataset, choose the right number of clusters by looking at the elbow method, and evaluate using the silhouette score.

## Customer Personality Analysis for Marketing Retargeting
The results of clustering that has been done before can be interpreted based on the characteristics of each group, how the cluster tends to respond to existing marketing campaigns, and how the potential revenue results are if we do retargeting marketing to the cluster.
